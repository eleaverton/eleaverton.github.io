		<h2> About Me </h2>

		<img id = bio-image src="assets/images/biopic2.jpg" alt="Liz Leaverton" >

		<p>Hi! I'm a chemical engineer doing process safety work in oil and gas by day, learning to code by night, and baking and quilting on the side. Soon, I'll be able to build you an awesome website!
		<br>
		<br>
		I'm from the Houston area and graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. My husband, Matt, and I met in our engineering physics class. I'm thankful that we can appreciate each other's nerdy humor and interests. He's the best person I know.
		<br>
		<br>
		Likes include cats, chocolate, mascots, Harry Potter, being fit-ish, traveling, and learning new things.
		<br>
		<br>
		Dislikes include Houston traffic, pimento cheese, loud/slobbery animals, and when people think they are an expert on something because they read an article on the internet.
		<br>
		<br>
		Check out a fan page for one of my favorite bands: <a href="https://eleaverton.github.io/chvrches/">CHVRCHES. </a>
